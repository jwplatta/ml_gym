The basic counting principle counts {{c1::all possible outcomes}} from sequential experiments, permutations count {{c2::ordered arrangements}} from a set, and combinations count {{c3::unordered groups}} from a set.

For overlapping events E and F, the union probability is: {{c1::$P(E \cup F) = P(E) + P(F) - P(EF)$}}. We subtract {{c2::$P(EF)$}} because it is {{c3::already counted in both $P(E)$ and $P(F)$}}.
