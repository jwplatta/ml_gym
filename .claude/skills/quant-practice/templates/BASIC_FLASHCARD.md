What is the basic principle of counting?
Back:
For experiments A and B, if A results in m possible outcomes and B results in n possible outcomes, then the total possible outcomes is $m \times n$. This principle can be generalized by multiplying the number of possible outcomes for each experiment together.

What key distinction separates the basic counting principle from permutations and combinations?
Back:
The basic counting principle counts ALL possible outcomes from sequential experiments, while permutations and combinations specifically count different arrangements or selections from a single set of n objects.

What is the formula for combinations and what does it represent?
Back:
"n choose r" = $\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!r!}$

This gives the number of different groups of r objects that can be formed from a total of n objects. The division by $r!$ removes the ordering that would be present in permutations.
