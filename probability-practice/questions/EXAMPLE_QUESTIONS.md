## Multinomial Coefficients

QUESTION: A police department in a small city consists of 10 officers. If the department policy is to have 5 of the officers patrolling the streets, 2 of the officers working full time at the station, and 3 of the officers on reserve at the station, how many different divisions of the 10 officers into the 3 groups are possible?
SOLUTION: There are 10! / (5! 2! 3!) = 2520 possible divisions.

QUESTION: In the first round of a knockout tournament involving n = 2m players, the n players are divided into n/2 pairs, with each of these pairs then playing a game. The losers of the games are eliminated while the winners go on to the next round, where the process is repeated until only a single player remains. Suppose we have a knockout tournament of 8 players.

## Sample Space Size

QUESTION: If the outcome of an experiment consists in the determination of the sex of a newborn child, then S = {g, b} where the outcome g means that the child is a girl and b that it is a boy

QUESTION: If the outcome of an experiment is the order of finish in a race among the 7 horses having post positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, then S = {all 7! permutations of (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)}. The outcome (2, 3, 1, 6, 5, 4, 7) means, for instance, that the number 2 horse comes in first, then the number 3 horse, then the number 1 horse, and so on

QUESTION: If the experiment consists of flipping two coins, then the sample space consists of the following four points: S = {(H, H),(H, T),(T, H),(T, T)}. The outcome will be (H, H) if both coins are heads, (H, T) if the first coin is heads and the second tails, (T, H) if the first is tails and the second heads, and (T, T) if both coins are tails

QUESTION: If the experiment consists of tossing two dice, then the sample space consists of the 36 points S = {(i, j): i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} where the outcome (i, j) is said to occur if i appears on the leftmost die and j on the other die.

## Probability Axioms

QUESTION: J is taking two books along on her holiday vacation. With probability .5, she will like the first book; with probability .4, she will like the second book; and with probability .3, she will like both books. What is the probability that she likes neither book?

QUESTION: An urn contains n balls, one of which is special. If k of these balls are withdrawn one at a time, with each selection being equally likely to be any of the balls that remain at the time, what is the probability that the special ball is chosen?

QUESTION: Suppose that n + m balls, of which n are red and m are blue, are arranged in a linear order in such a way that all (n + m)! possible orderings are equally likely. If we record the result of this experiment by listing only the colors of the successive balls, show that all the possible results remain equally likely.

QUESTION:A poker hand consists of 5 cards. If the cards have distinct consecutive values and are not all of the same suit, we say that the hand is a straight. For instance, a hand consisting of the five of spades, six of spades, seven of spades, eight of spades, and nine of hearts is a straight. What is the probability that one is dealt a straight?

QUESTION: A 5-card poker hand is said to be a full house if it consists of 3 cards of the same denomination and 2 other cards of the same denomination (of course, different from the first denomination). Thus, one kind of full house is three of a kind plus a pair. What is the probability that one is dealt a full house?

QUESTION: In the game of bridge, the entire deck of 52 cards is dealt out to 4 players. What is the probability that (a) one of the players receives all 13 spades; (b) each player receives 1 ace?

QUESTION: If n people are present in a room, what is the probability that no two of them celebrate their birthday on the same day of the year? How large need n be so that this probability is less than 1/2 ?

QUESTION: A deck of 52 playing cards is shuffled, and the cards are turned up one at a time until the first ace appears. Is the next card—that is, the card following the first ace—more likely to be the ace of spades or the two of clubs?

QUESTION: A football team consists of 20 offensive and 20 defensive players. The players are to be paired in groups of 2 for the purpose of determining roommates. If the pairing is done at random, what is the probability that there are no offensive–defensive roommate pairs? What is the probability that there are 2i offensive–defensive roommate pairs, i = 1, 2, ... , 10?

QUESTION: A total of 36 members of a club play tennis, 28 play squash, and 18 play badminton. Furthermore, 22 of the members play both tennis and squash, 12 play both tennis and badminton, 9 play both squash and badminton, and 4 play all three sports. How many members of this club play at least one of three sports?

QUESTION: Suppose that each of N men at a party throws his hat into the center of the room. The hats are first mixed up, and then each man randomly selects a hat. What is the probability that none of the men selects his own hat?

QUESTION: Compute the probability that 10 married couples are seated at random at a round table, then no wife sits next to her husband.

QUESTION: Suppose that, in a 7-horse race, you feel that each of the first 2 horses has a 20 percent chance of winning, horses 3 and 4 each have a 15 percent chance, and the remaining 3 horses have a 10 percent chance each. Would it be better for you to wager at even money that the winner will be one of the first three horses or to wager, again at even money, that the winner will be one of the horses 1, 5, 6, and 7?
